# DESIGN PROMPT 18 — Admin, security, and maintenance center design

## Goal

Upgrade protected admin/security/maintenance UI for restricted hosting: health checks, processing, cleanup, failed items, storage, demo reset, and safety confirmations.

This prompt is designed to run in parallel with other design prompts. Work only on this assigned area unless a shared component change is absolutely required.

## Read first

- `../GLOBAL_DESIGN_RULES.md`
- `../PARALLEL_MERGE_MATRIX.md`
- existing project docs and progress files
- current routes/components/views for this area

## Scope boundaries

Touch admin/maintenance UI only. Do not expose secrets or create production demo reset.

## Inspect before changing

Inspect health check page, processing panels, cleanup tools, storage status, failed jobs/processes, demo reset, admin auth.

## Required implementation

Create clean admin dashboard, health cards, processing panels, cleanup reports, retry/resume actions, storage usage display, safe danger confirmations, and local-only demo reset UI.

## Mobile requirements

Admin panels stack with clear danger warnings.

## Tablet requirements

Use cards and tabs for health/processing/storage.

## Desktop requirements

Use structured admin grid with detail panels.

## Flux, Livewire, Tailwind, SCSS requirements

- Use Flux v2 components where possible.
- Use Livewire for interactive UI state.
- Use Tailwind CSS 4 utilities for layout, spacing, typography, responsiveness, and states.
- Use SCSS only for reusable design helpers that are cleaner than repeating utilities.
- Do not create one-off messy CSS.
- Do not introduce another UI library.
- Do not use Volt.
- If touched UI uses Volt, migrate touched behavior to normal class-based Livewire.
- Keep all visible text translated.
- Do not hardcode labels, buttons, placeholders, empty states, errors, or confirmation text.

## Accessibility requirements

- Every input needs a proper label.
- Every icon-only button needs an accessible name.
- Focus states must be visible.
- Modals/dropdowns must be keyboard usable.
- Status must not rely only on color.
- Error messages must be associated with fields.
- Cards/lists must have meaningful headings or structure.
- Long content must remain readable.
- Loading states must be understandable.
- Empty states must be helpful.

## Security and privacy guardrails

- Do not weaken authorization.
- Do not expose private data through UI previews, dashboard cards, search suggestions, notifications, comments, files, or links.
- Do not show demo credentials outside local/testing/demo.
- Do not turn hidden frontend controls into the only security layer.
- Keep backend policies intact.
- Do not change invite, attachment, export, or admin access rules unless this prompt explicitly touches that area.
- If you discover a security issue, document it in the report and fix it only if the fix is safely within scope.

## Tests and checks

Test normal users denied, admin allowed, demo reset hidden in production, no secret values exposed.

## Required report

Create or update:

`DESIGN_AGENT_REPORT_18.md`

The report must include:

- prompt number and title
- files inspected
- files changed
- mobile changes
- tablet changes
- desktop changes
- Flux components used
- Livewire components touched
- translation keys added/changed
- accessibility improvements
- tests/checks run
- screenshots/manual review notes if available
- possible merge conflicts
- known risks
- exact next recommendation
