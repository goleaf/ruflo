# DESIGN PROMPT 10 — Kanban and calendar design

## Goal

Upgrade Kanban board and calendar views for mobile/tablet/desktop without paid calendar or drag libraries unless already free/self-hosted.

This prompt is designed to run in parallel with other design prompts. Work only on this assigned area unless a shared component change is absolutely required.

## Read first

- `../GLOBAL_DESIGN_RULES.md`
- `../PARALLEL_MERGE_MATRIX.md`
- existing project docs and progress files
- current routes/components/views for this area

## Scope boundaries

Touch Kanban/calendar UI only. Keep lifecycle/state rules intact.

## Inspect before changing

Inspect Kanban columns/cards, calendar grid/list, due date rendering, recurring occurrences, drag/drop fallback, mobile behavior.

## Required implementation

Create responsive Kanban columns, mobile column switcher, calendar month/week/list modes if available, event cards, fallback move buttons, and clear empty days/columns.

## Mobile requirements

Prefer list/column switcher over cramped horizontal board. Calendar must have agenda fallback.

## Tablet requirements

Use scrollable columns or 2-column calendar/agenda hybrid.

## Desktop requirements

Use full board/calendar with clear density and keyboard-friendly fallback actions.

## Flux, Livewire, Tailwind, SCSS requirements

- Use Flux v2 components where possible.
- Use Livewire for interactive UI state.
- Use Tailwind CSS 4 utilities for layout, spacing, typography, responsiveness, and states.
- Use SCSS only for reusable design helpers that are cleaner than repeating utilities.
- Do not create one-off messy CSS.
- Do not introduce another UI library.
- Do not use Volt.
- If touched UI uses Volt, migrate touched behavior to normal class-based Livewire.
- Keep all visible text translated.
- Do not hardcode labels, buttons, placeholders, empty states, errors, or confirmation text.

## Accessibility requirements

- Every input needs a proper label.
- Every icon-only button needs an accessible name.
- Focus states must be visible.
- Modals/dropdowns must be keyboard usable.
- Status must not rely only on color.
- Error messages must be associated with fields.
- Cards/lists must have meaningful headings or structure.
- Long content must remain readable.
- Loading states must be understandable.
- Empty states must be helpful.

## Security and privacy guardrails

- Do not weaken authorization.
- Do not expose private data through UI previews, dashboard cards, search suggestions, notifications, comments, files, or links.
- Do not show demo credentials outside local/testing/demo.
- Do not turn hidden frontend controls into the only security layer.
- Keep backend policies intact.
- Do not change invite, attachment, export, or admin access rules unless this prompt explicitly touches that area.
- If you discover a security issue, document it in the report and fix it only if the fix is safely within scope.

## Tests and checks

Test moving task/state through UI actions and calendar links remain scoped.

## Required report

Create or update:

`DESIGN_AGENT_REPORT_10.md`

The report must include:

- prompt number and title
- files inspected
- files changed
- mobile changes
- tablet changes
- desktop changes
- Flux components used
- Livewire components touched
- translation keys added/changed
- accessibility improvements
- tests/checks run
- screenshots/manual review notes if available
- possible merge conflicts
- known risks
- exact next recommendation
